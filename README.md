# About Me
I am a fresh master's student working on **Quantum Darwinism** and **Quantum Reference Frame**s at [Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory Group](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~mfq/). To be quite frank, I find programming a bit boring (except when it comes to solving a mathematical or physics problem), but hey, I guess sooner or later one will have to learn a thing or two about it.
